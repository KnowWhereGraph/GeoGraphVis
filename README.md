# GeoGraphVis

A geovisualization tool empowered by knowledge graph technology which enables intelligent decision making and problem solving, and further supports disaster response and humanitarian aid. There are three innovative features of this solution:
- A location-aware knowledge graph is created to link and integrate cross-domain data to make the graph analytics-ready. 
- Expert-driven disaster response workflows are analyzed and modeled as machine-understandable decision paths to guide knowledge exploration via the graph. 
- A scene-based visualization strategy is developed to enable interactive and heuristic visual analytics to better comprehend disaster impact situations and develop action plans for humanitarian aid.

## Runing and Deploying

In the project directory, you can run scripts:

### `npm install`

Install all the required node modules for the app. 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
